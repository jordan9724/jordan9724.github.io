# Intro

Not too long ago image classification was found to be a difficult and unwieldy task for many of the novel machine
learning algorithms. However, the entire field witnessed the astounding ground-breaking accomplishment made by Alex
Krizhevsky when he submitted his [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)][@alexnet] to the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge][@imagenet] in 2012 which won with a 15.3% error rate over the second place competitor with an
error rate of 26.2%. Following his jaw-dropping performance, [CNNs have become the engine that drives every achievement
we see in computer vision research][@seif].

Despite CNNs becoming the mainstream machine vision algorithm to use after Alex Krizhevsky made AlexNet, they were
actually invented all the way back in [1994 when Yann LeCun made LeNet5][@cnnhistory]. However, what made AlexNet so
much more powerful over LeNet5 was its ability
