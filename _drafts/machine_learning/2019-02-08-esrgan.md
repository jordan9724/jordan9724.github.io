# What is ESRGAN?
ESRGAN stands for "Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network". The work improves previous work of
super resolving low resolution images with a generative adversarial network from the original
[SR-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802.pdf). GANs are becoming more popular in super
resolution tasks due to their ability to mimic realistic images, making the super resolved image much clearer to a
human. The other popular way to super resolve images comes from minimizing a loss function, which can lead to unpleasing
consequences, such as blurriness in the final super resolved image.
